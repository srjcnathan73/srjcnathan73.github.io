                                        <p>When our 17 year old grandson from Michigan came to California to live with us, our own children were long gone so we had been out of the need for any Auto Body work. His first day here he crashed our car. We took
                                            it to the local familiar name repair shop and they quoted us $3,000.00. This was a terrible amount to have to pay on day one of our grandson's year here.
                                            <br>We took the car for a second estimate at Carl's Body Shop but did not tell them of the first estimate. They looked it over and ... came up with an estimate of $1500.00. We were
                                            thrilled</p>

                                        <p>...in the fast lane of a construction zone during rush hour traffic, my son drove off on a stub but he was still alive! I wanted that truck totaled, but the insurance company had something else in mind.
                                            <br/>Bruce fixed my son's truck to make it look like new again. More important, he thought of the safety issues that were paramount on my mind and suggested my son put stock size tires back on the truck to prevent
                                            the wheels from flying off. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Bruce and his family-run business for keeping my family safe...</p>

                                            for all their customers. They will not cut corners just to get the job: They Do It Right!</p>

                                            They were ready able and willing to repair frame damage to my
